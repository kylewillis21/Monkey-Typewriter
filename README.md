# Monkey Typewriter
This program was written to test the Infinite Monkey Theorem. The basic theory is that if you allow a monkey to 
randomly hit a typewriter for an infinite amount of time, the monkey would eventually type out the entire works of Shakespeare.

[More information on the theorem can be found here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem)
